Bicarbonate-extractable K+,parts per million,"18A1. Available potassium (HCO3) (ppm). Bicarbonate extractable potassium was measured on a solution of 1 g soil: 100 mL 0.5 M NaHC03.

The value obtained is a measure of the water soluble potassium together with the exchangeable potassium. Water soluble potassium is negligible in nonsaline soils so bicarbonate extractable potassium is, in fact, exchangeable potassium.
