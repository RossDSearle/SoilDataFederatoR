10D1,"10D1. Extractable sulphur (40øC for 3 hours, 0.25M KCl, measured by ICP; Blair, G.J., Chinoim, N., Lefroy, R.B., Anderson, G.C. & Crocker, G.J. (1991) A soil sulfur test for pasture and crops. Australian Journal of Soil Research, 29, 619?626.) We analysed a single bulked sample of the top 10 cm of soil from aggregation of multiple 2 cm diameter sub-samples collected from throughout each of 52 50 x 50 m plots sampled in spring 2010. Samples were stored at ~4øC until delivery to the CSBP Futurefarm analytical laboratories (Bibra Lake, WA), where they were thoroughly mixed, air dried at 40øC, and ground to pass through a 2 mm sieve. Analyses were undertaken on each bulked sample."
11A1,"11A. Percent gypsum (%). Clay mineralogy of samples were estimated semi-quantitatively from a combination of X-ray diffraction and X-ray spectrometry by the method described by Raven and Milnes (1988). Soil mechanical and macro-nutrient analyses were undertaken on a stratified bulked soil sample from the top 10 cm was collected from the 10 m x 10 m subplot. Samples, each about 1 kg, were air dried in a glasshouse, crushed in a mortar, and passed through a stainless steel 2 mm screen, for chemical analyses (on the <2mm fraction).

18A1,"18A1. Available potassium (HCO3) (ppm). Bicarbonate extractable potassium was measured on a solution of 1 g soil: 100 mL 0.5 M NaHC03. Potassium was determined on this 1:100 extract using atomic absorption spectroscopy with in-line neutralization of the bicarbonate extract (Jeffery, 1982). The value obtained is a measure of the water soluble potassium together with the exchangeable potassium. Water soluble potassium is negligible in nonsaline soils so bicarbonate extractable potassium is, in fact, exchangeable potassium.

9A3,"9A. Total P (Phophorus). Boiling chips and 0.5ml HNO3 (nitric acid) were added to replicate samples of 0.5g of each soilsample. After the brown fumes had stopped 1ml of HClO4 (perchloric acid) was added and digestion continued on a block digester (Diotype Equipment). At the completion of digestion samples were made up to 10mls with deionized distilled water. The orthophosphate formed during this digestion was then determined by a modified single solution method of Murphey & Riley (1962), using a spectrophotometer.  Most samples represent a composite of material through one depth profile. Certain samples were divided to determine variation between surface and subsurface conditions. Samples were air dried, weighed and passed through 2mm sieve and then reweighed to determine the proportion of the whole sample in the general gravel class (>2mm)."
