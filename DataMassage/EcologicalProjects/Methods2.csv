Very Coarse Gravel,percent,"Gravel >16mm %. Surface soil samples (at 5?15 cm depth) were collected from 30 spaced points and bulked in the field to yield approximately 2.5 kg samples. Lyons, M.N.

Zinc,milligrams per kilogram,"Zinc Zn, extracted by Mehlich No 3 - method S42. Concentrations below 0.1 mg/kg are displayed as 0 as they are below the resolution of the sampling method, i.e. the element is either present in the sample at very low concentration or not present. Twenty soil samples of the upper 10cm were collected from across the quadrat (four lines of five samples). The samples were combined and sieved through a 2mm sieve, with a minimum of 500g collected in a calico bag for laboratory analysis.
