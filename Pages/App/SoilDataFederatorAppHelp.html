<H1> About the SoilDataFederator</H1>
<p>The SoilDataFederator is a web API that brings together soil site data from a range of disparate data sources.
It removes the complexity and hassles associated with trying to access and use soil data from different sources.
It allows the user to query soil data stores across Australia in a consistent manner and the data returned is a consistent format.
Users do not need to know the details of each of the individual data stores structures and querying mechanisms.
The data in the system is historical soil survey data and is composed of both soil morphological description data and laboratory analysis data.
The SoilDataFederator will return all available data for a specified soil property.
</p>

<p>
While the <a href='http://esoil.io/TERNLandscapes/SoilDataFederatoR/__swagger__/#'  target="_blank"> SoilDataFederator API</a> is meant to be the primary means of accessing federated soils data we have also made this Web App available for simple manual querying of the API.
It is a simple interface which simply delivers the data from the API as is. You need to have an API key in order to use this App. You need to
<a href='https://shiny.esoil.io/SoilDataFederator/Pages/Register/'  target="_blank"> register</a> to receive an API key for using this App. If you don't wo't to register
but instead just use the "Demo", "Demo" credentials, only the first 5 records from the CSIRO NatSoil dataset will be returned for demonstration purposes.
