<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 105%; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;">DSM Tools is an App for generating soil
property maps using Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) techniques, without needing to
know the details of what is happening behind the scenes. You supply your soil
sample data and set of environmental covariate rasters, and it will generate
maps of your chosen soil properties.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: Calibri;" class="MsoNormal"><big>The Appp uses
the concept of Projects, within which you upload a set of covariates
rasters, your soil sample data and generate a series of statistically
modelled soil maps using Machine Learning Algorithms. You work your way
from left to right on the tabs at the top of the page to undertake the
DSM modelling</big></p>
<h2><big><small style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);"><span style="font-family: Arial Black;">1. Projects</span></small><br>
</big></h2>
<p style="font-family: Calibri;" class="MsoNormal"><big>You begin the
DSM workflow by creating a new project. You need to supply a name and
upload a Spatial "Template" raster as a geoTif file. This template will
control the extent and resolution of all subsequent DSM Modelling
products. If you have an existing project, you can select it here and
move on to the rest of the workflow. Projects can be deleted and
renamed here as well. Once you delete a raster, all the data and the
generated modelling products associated with the project are also
permanently deleted as well.</big></p>

<h2><big><small style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);"><span style="font-family: Arial Black;">2. Covariate Rasters<br>
</span></small></big></h2>

<p style="font-family: Calibri;" class="MsoNormal">The "Covariates Rasters' Tab allows you to upload, view and transform raster covariates to be used in your DSM.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Upload</span></h3>
In the "Currently Available Project Covariates" tab you click the
browse button to select covariates from your local machine that you
wish to upload to DSMTool. When they are uploaded, the new covariates
will automatically be reprojected and resized to match the project
template raster. Presently only Geotif rasters are accepted by
DSMTools. The filename of the uploaded covariate rasters will be used
to identify the rasters in DSMTools. <br>
<br>
An image of all the existing available covariate rasters will also be displayed on the right<br>
<br>
<h3 style="font-family: Calibri;">Explore</h3>
Selecting a covariate in the "Available Covariates" dropdown, will
dipslay a map of the covariate abd show some statistics about the
current covariate raster. Some simple transformation can also be
applied to the selected covariate to produce new covariate rasters, by
using the tools on the left of the tab in the "Transform Values" tab.<br>
<br>
Covariates can also be deleted and renamed in this tab.<br>
<br>

</span></small></big></h2>
<h3><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Upload</span></h3>

This tab allows you to upload soil sample files to be used in the DSM
modelling. Click on the browse button to select a csv file to be
uploaded to DSM tools. The image below shows the format that the file
needs to be in to be read correctly by DSMTools.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 1200px; height: 377px;" alt="Soil sample data format" src="http://shiny.esoil.io/DSMTools/CSVDataFormat.png"><br>

<p style="font-family: Calibri;" class="MsoNormal"><big>You are required to supply fields containing data describing,&nbsp; the Site Identifier, the Location of the soil sample sites (eg Easting &amp; Northing) and the Depth at which the sample was taken.
You can optionally supply fields for Transect Ids and Stratification
IDS, which can be used optionally in the subsequent modelling..</big></p>
<p style="font-family: Calibri;" class="MsoNormal"><big>When the file is uploaded, DSMTools will automatically try to guess the field names in your file for these required fields.
If matches are not automatically made you are required to manually
chose the correct fields. You must also specify a numerical value for
the&nbsp; NA value in your data file. The renaming fields that you wish
to import (ie values for soil properties to be modelled) can be selected in the "Sample Data Fields" list box.</big></p>
<big><span style="font-family: Calibri;">You then need to click the
"Process My Data" button to make the sample data available in the
current project. The imported table will be diplayed on the right</span></big><br>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Explore Sample Data</span></h3>
<big><span style="font-family: Calibri;">You can select individual soil
properties from the combo box on the left to show a range of statistics
for this particular soil attribute.</span><br style="font-family: Calibri;">
<br style="font-family: Calibri;">
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The Attribute selected here is the
one that will be used in subsequent modelling. ie if you want to cahnge
the value to be modelled, you need to come back to this combo box and
select the required soil attribute.</span></big><br>

</span></small></big></h2>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><big>Click on the "Drill Raster"
button to generate a table containing the values of the covariate
rasters at all of the soil sample site locations. The file generated
here is used as input to the Machine Learning Models used in the DSM.
The table will be displayed on the right once it is generated.<br>
</big><br>

<h2><big><small style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);"><span style="font-family: Arial Black;">5. Run a Model<br>
</span></small></big></h2>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><big>Choose a soil attribute to be
modelled and select the profile depth for which you wish to model. You
can manually enter a name to identify the model, otherwise a name will
automatically be assigned based on the soil attribute name and the
depth. The model will be generated and information about the model will
be displayed on the right. This processing can take a long time</big>.<br>
<br>
There are some advanced option you can change.<br>
